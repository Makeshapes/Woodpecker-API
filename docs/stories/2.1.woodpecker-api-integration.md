# Story 2.1: Woodpecker API Integration & Campaign Management

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** sales team member,
**I want** to add approved prospects directly to existing Woodpecker campaigns,
**so that** I can seamlessly integrate AI-generated content into my established outreach workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Woodpecker API integration configured with environment variable API key
2. Dropdown interface displays existing Woodpecker campaigns for selection
3. JSON formatting automatically converts approved content to Woodpecker format
4. Batch export functionality adds multiple prospects to selected campaign simultaneously
5. Real-time export progress tracking with individual success/failure status
6. Error handling for API failures with retry options and clear user feedback
7. Validation prevents duplicate prospect additions to same campaign
8. Export confirmation dialog summarizes prospects being added and target campaign

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Epic 1 established the foundation with Lead management, CSV import, and AI content generation
- ContentGeneration.tsx generates 7-snippet email sequences stored in generatedContent state
- Lead data structure includes: company, contactName, email, title, linkedInUrl, personalizedReason
- LocalStorage is used for persisting lead data between sessions
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Current Tech Stack (from Epic 1)

- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
- UI Components: ShadCN UI + Radix UI primitives
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React hooks and local component state
- API Integration: Direct frontend API calls (Phase 1 approach)
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library
  [Source: package.json, existing implementation]

### File Locations

Based on existing project structure:

- New service: src/services/woodpeckerService.ts
- New components: src/components/export/
  - CampaignSelector.tsx
  - ExportToWoodpecker.tsx
- New utilities: src/utils/woodpeckerFormatter.ts
- Tests: Follow existing pattern with \*.test.ts files alongside implementation
  [Source: existing file structure]

### API Integration Pattern

Following existing Claude API integration pattern from src/services/claudeService.ts:

- Environment variable for API key (VITE_WOODPECKER_API_KEY)
- Direct frontend API calls using fetch
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states during API operations
  [Source: existing implementation patterns]

### Component Patterns

Following existing ShadCN UI patterns:

- Use Sheet/Dialog for modal interfaces
- Use Select for dropdown selections
- Use Button with loading states for actions
- Use Card for content sections
- Use Badge for status indicators
  [Source: existing component usage]

### Woodpecker API Requirements

Based on PRD specifications:

- Rate limit: 100 requests/minute
- Prospect format needs to match Woodpecker JSON structure
- Campaign ID required for adding prospects
- Batch operations supported for efficiency
  [Source: docs/prd.md#58-59, #248-251]

### Data Flow

1. User reviews and approves content in ContentGeneration component
2. Approved leads with generated content ready for export
3. User selects target Woodpecker campaign from dropdown
4. System converts lead + content to Woodpecker format
5. Batch API calls add prospects to campaign
6. Progress tracked and results displayed to user
   [Source: Epic 2 requirements]

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all new service methods and utilities
- Integration tests for complete export workflow
- Mock Woodpecker API responses for testing
- Test error scenarios and retry logic
- Follow existing testing patterns with Vitest
  [Source: existing test patterns]

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- Test files located alongside implementation files (\*.test.ts)
- Use Vitest for unit testing
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external API calls to avoid dependencies
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage on new code
- Test both success and failure scenarios
  [Source: existing test implementation patterns]

## Notes

### Woodpecker API Quick Reference

**Base URL:** `https://api.woodpecker.co/rest`

**Authentication:**
- Header: `x-api-key: {YOUR_API_KEY}`
- Store in environment variable: `VITE_WOODPECKER_API_KEY`

**Key Endpoint:**
- `POST /v1/add_prospects_campaign` - Add prospects to campaign
  - Required: `prospects[].email`, `campaign.campaign_id`
  - Optional: `force` (add non-ACTIVE prospects), `file_name` (batch name)
  - Supports up to 20,000 prospects per request
  - Rate limit: 100 requests/minute

**Prospect Mapping:**
- Map 7 generated email snippets to `snippet1` through `snippet7`
- Map lead fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `company`, `title`, `linkedin_url`
- HTML content supported in snippets (use `<br/>` for line breaks)

**Error Handling:**
- Standard HTTP codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500)
- Response includes `status` object with `code` and `msg`
- `DUPLICATE` indicator for existing prospects (doesn't prevent addition)
