# Epic 4: Data Persistence & Production Deployment

## Epic Goal

Complete the production-ready application by implementing SQLite database for export tracking, establishing Docker-based deployment infrastructure following the Postiz pattern, and creating monitoring and maintenance procedures. This epic delivers a fully deployed, production-ready internal tool with data persistence and operational reliability.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**

- **Project Type:** Production deployment and data persistence for completed Woodpecker-API tool
- **Technology Stack:** SQLite database integration, Docker Compose deployment, DigitalOcean hosting
- **Integration Points:** Database integration with backend, CI/CD pipeline, production monitoring

**Epic Details:**

- **What's being created:** Production deployment infrastructure with data persistence and monitoring
- **How it integrates:** Adds database layer to backend and establishes production deployment pipeline
- **Success criteria:** Fully deployed, monitored application with export tracking and operational procedures

## Stories

1. **Story 4.1:** SQLite Database & Export Tracking Implementation - Database schema and export history tracking
2. **Story 4.2:** Frontend-Backend Integration & Data Flow - Complete data flow integration with database persistence
3. **Story 4.3:** Docker Compose Infrastructure & Environment Configuration - Containerized deployment setup
4. **Story 4.4:** DigitalOcean Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline - Production deployment with automated CI/CD

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] All Epic 3 backend functionality maintained with database integration
- [ ] Frontend application continues to function with enhanced backend data persistence
- [ ] Docker containers maintain performance characteristics of development environment
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline supports rollback to previous versions
- [ ] Production environment matches development environment behavior

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Production deployment introduces performance degradation or data loss
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing pipeline, database backup procedures, staged deployment with rollback capabilities
- **Rollback Plan:** Automated rollback to previous Docker image version, database backup restoration procedures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 4 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] SQLite database successfully tracks export history without data loss
- [ ] Complete application deployed to DigitalOcean with HTTPS and internal access controls
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys updates with proper testing gates
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting notify team of system issues
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Performance testing validates production environment meets requirements

## Success Metrics

- Database operations complete in under 500ms for typical queries
- Application deployment completes in under 10 minutes via CI/CD pipeline
- System uptime maintains 99.9%+ during business hours
- Export tracking provides complete audit trail with no data loss

## Dependencies

- Epic 3 (Backend Infrastructure & Security) completed
- DigitalOcean account and deployment environment configured
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline permissions configured
- Domain and SSL certificate configuration ready

## Integration Points

- **From Epic 3:** Secure backend infrastructure with API proxies
- **Production Environment:** DigitalOcean deployment, GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Database:** SQLite integration with backend for export tracking

## Production Requirements

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose orchestration following Postiz deployment pattern
- HTTPS with Let's Encrypt for secure access
- Internal network access controls for team-only usage
- Persistent volumes for SQLite database data

**Operational:**
- Automated backups of SQLite database
- Log aggregation and monitoring
- Alerting for system failures or performance issues
- Documentation for maintenance and troubleshooting

## Handoff Notes for Story Development

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this production deployment epic. Key considerations:

- This completes the production-ready Woodpecker-API tool deployment
- Integration points: SQLite database with backend, Docker Compose deployment, DigitalOcean hosting
- Existing patterns to maintain: All Epic 3 backend functionality with added database persistence
- Critical requirements: Data persistence, reliable deployment, monitoring and alerting, backup procedures
- Each story must include production testing and operational procedures
- Focus on delivering a fully operational internal tool with proper DevOps practices

The epic should deliver a production-ready, monitored, and maintainable application that the Makeshapes team can rely on for their email personalization workflow."
