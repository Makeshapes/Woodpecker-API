# Story 1.2: CSV Import & Validation Interface

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** sales team member,
**I want** to upload CSV files containing lead data with automatic validation,
**so that** I can quickly import my prospect lists and identify any data quality issues before processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Drag-and-drop CSV upload component implemented using ShadCN UI
2. Automatic column mapping detects standard fields (company, contact name, email, title)
3. Data validation identifies missing required fields and displays clear error messages
4. Upload progress indicator shows file processing status
5. Preview of imported data displays in a table format before confirmation
6. Support for CSV files up to 1000 leads without performance degradation
7. Clear success/failure feedback with actionable error messages

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Enhance existing Import page with CSV upload functionality (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Replace placeholder drag-drop area in src/pages/Import.tsx with functional CSV upload
  - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop handlers with visual feedback (Card, Button already available)
  - [ ] Add file input fallback for non-drag-and-drop users
  - [ ] Create upload progress indicator with percentage and status

- [ ] Implement CSV parsing and column mapping (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install and configure CSV parsing library (Papa Parse)
  - [ ] Create column detection logic for standard fields
  - [ ] Build column mapping interface for manual corrections
  - [ ] Handle various CSV formats and encoding issues

- [ ] Add data validation and error handling (AC: 3, 7)
  - [ ] Create validation rules for required fields (email, company, contact name)
  - [ ] Implement email format validation
  - [ ] Build error display component with clear messaging
  - [ ] Add actionable suggestions for fixing common issues

- [ ] Create data preview interface (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Install and configure ShadCN Table component (not yet available)
  - [ ] Build preview table component for CSV data display
  - [ ] Add pagination or virtualization for large datasets
  - [ ] Show column mapping results with validation status
  - [ ] Provide confirmation/cancel actions before proceeding

- [ ] Optimize performance for large files (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement streaming CSV parsing for memory efficiency
  - [ ] Add debouncing for real-time validation feedback
  - [ ] Test with 1000+ lead CSV files for performance
  - [ ] Implement error boundaries for graceful failure handling

## Dev Notes

**Story 1.1 Implementation Context:**
Story 1.1 completed project setup and created the foundation:
- Basic Import page exists at `src/pages/Import.tsx` with placeholder drag-drop area
- ShadCN UI Card and Button components already installed and configured  
- Project structure established with all required folders (components/, pages/, lib/, utils/)
- Theme provider and basic routing already functional
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library set up

**CSV Processing Requirements:**
The system must handle typical sales CSV exports from CRMs like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Pipedrive. Common column variations include:
- Company: "Company", "Company Name", "Account", "Organization"
- Contact: "Contact Name", "Full Name", "First Name" + "Last Name"
- Email: "Email", "Email Address", "Work Email"
- Title: "Title", "Job Title", "Position", "Role"

**Data Quality Expectations:**
Based on PRD requirements, the system should maintain high data quality standards:
- Required fields validation prevents downstream issues
- Email format validation ensures deliverability
- Duplicate detection may be needed for same email addresses

**Performance Requirements:**
The PRD specifies support for 1000+ leads without performance degradation. This requires:
- Streaming CSV parsing to avoid memory issues
- Virtual scrolling for preview tables
- Efficient validation algorithms

**UI/UX Requirements:**
Following the PRD's "clean, efficient workflow-focused interface":
- Drag-and-drop should be intuitive and provide clear visual feedback
- Error messages should be actionable, not just informational
- Progress indicators should show clear status during file processing

### Testing

**Test File Location:** Co-located tests (`src/pages/Import.test.tsx`, `src/components/csv-upload/CsvUpload.test.tsx`, etc.)

**Test Standards:**
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- File upload simulation using mock File objects
- CSV parsing tests with various file formats
- Validation logic unit tests
- Performance tests with large CSV files

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Upload component renders and accepts files correctly
- Column mapping detects standard field variations
- Validation identifies missing required fields accurately
- Preview table displays imported data correctly
- Performance tests confirm 1000+ lead support
- Error handling gracefully manages invalid files
