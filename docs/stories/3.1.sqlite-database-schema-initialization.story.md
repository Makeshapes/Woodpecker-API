## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to design and implement the database schema with tables for `imports`, `leads`, `generated_content`, and `app_metadata`,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in Epic 3.

### Data Models
No specific guidance found in architecture docs. Based on Epic 3 requirements, the following tables are needed:

**imports table:**
- Tracks CSV import sessions
- Fields: id, filename, import_date, status, lead_count, error_messages

**leads table:**
- Stores individual lead data from CSV imports
- Fields: id, import_id (FK), company, contact_name, email, title, additional_fields (JSON), status, woodpecker_campaign_id, export_date, created_at

**generated_content table:**
- Stores AI-generated email sequences
- Fields: id, lead_id (FK), touchpoint_number, content, content_type, template_id, status, generated_at, approved_at

**mappings table:**
- Stores field mappings between CSV columns and Woodpecker API fields
- Fields: id, import_id (FK), csv_column, woodpecker_field, mapping_type, is_active, created_at

**app_metadata table:**
- Application configuration and state
- Fields: key, value, updated_at

### API Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### File Locations
Based on Epic 3 requirements:
- Database file: `leads.db` in user's application data directory
- Database modules should be created in backend structure
- SQLite integration using `better-sqlite3` library

### Testing Requirements
No specific guidance found in architecture docs. Standard unit testing practices should apply:
- Test database initialization
- Test schema creation
- Test error handling
- Test data integrity

### Technical Constraints
- Use `better-sqlite3` library for SQLite integration
- Database must be file-based for persistence across app restarts
- Must accommodate all data fields currently stored in `localStorage`
- Performance must be optimized for efficient queries

### Testing
**Test file location:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs
**Test standards:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs
**Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs
**Specific testing requirements:** 
- Database initialization tests
- Schema validation tests
- Error handling tests
- Data integrity tests

### File List
**New Files Created:**
- `src/database/schema.ts` - Database schema definitions and SQL statements
- `src/database/init.ts` - Database initialization and connection management
- `src/database/utils.ts` - Database utilities and helper functions
- `src/database/index.ts` - Module exports
- `src/database/__tests__/init.test.ts` - Tests for initialization logic

**Key Database Functions Available:**
- `initializeDatabase()` - Creates and sets up database
- `getDatabase()` - Gets connection with auto-initialization
- `withDatabase()` - Execute operations with connection management
- `withTransaction()` - Execute operations within transactions
- Connection pooling and health checks built-in

**Migration Strategy:**
- Schema versioning implemented via `app_metadata` table
- Future schema changes can be handled through version-based migrations
- Current schema version: 1.0.0

**Performance Considerations:**
- WAL mode enabled for better concurrent access
- Indexes created for common query patterns
- Foreign key constraints enforced for data integrity

**Critical Information for Story 3.2 (DAL Implementation):**
