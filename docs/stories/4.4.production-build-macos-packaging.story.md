## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 4.1-4.3 completion:
- Complete Electron application shell established with secure main/renderer architecture
- All external API calls (Claude, Woodpecker) successfully migrated to main process with IPC bridge
- SQLite database integration functional with proper data persistence
- Development workflow established with concurrent Vite + Electron execution
- Security model proven with `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false`
- All application features from Epic 3 confirmed working in Electron environment

### Data Models
No specific data models required for packaging - this story focuses on build configuration and distribution.

### API Specifications
No new API specifications - packaging uses existing Electron APIs and build tools.

### Component Specifications
**Build Configuration:**
- **Electron Builder Config**: Complete macOS build configuration in package.json
- **Icon Assets**: Multi-resolution icon set (.icns format for macOS)
- **DMG Installer**: Custom installer appearance with branding
- **Universal Binary**: Support for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures

**Production Optimization:**
- **Bundle Analysis**: Minimize final application size
- **Environment Handling**: Proper production environment variable management
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress and optimize all included assets

### File Locations
Based on established Electron project structure from Stories 4.1-4.3:
- **Build Configuration**: `package.json` (add build section)
- **Icon Assets**: `assets/icons/` (new directory)
- **Build Scripts**: `scripts/build.js` (optional build helper)
- **Distribution Output**: `dist/` (electron-builder output)
- **Documentation**: `docs/deployment/` (installation and build docs)

### Technical Constraints
**Electron Builder Requirements:**
- Node.js 16+ required for electron-builder
- macOS development machine recommended for testing .dmg creation
- Sufficient disk space for universal binary compilation
- Apple Developer account required for code signing (optional)

**macOS Compatibility:**
- Target macOS 10.14+ for broad compatibility
- Universal binary supports both Intel and Apple Silicon
- DMG installer follows macOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Application bundle structure meets Apple requirements

**Build Performance:**
- Universal binary compilation increases build time significantly
- Large bundle size due to Electron runtime and Node.js dependencies
- Consider build caching for development workflow optimization

### Testing
**Test approach:** Manual testing on target macOS systems with automated build verification
**Testing requirements:**
- Build process completes successfully without errors
- Generated .dmg file opens and installs correctly
- Application launches and all features work in packaged version
- Icon and branding display correctly throughout macOS
- Installation works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Uninstallation process works cleanly
- Performance matches development version

**Test environments:**
- macOS 12+ on Apple Silicon (primary target)
- macOS 10.14+ on Intel (compatibility verification)
- Clean macOS systems without development tools
