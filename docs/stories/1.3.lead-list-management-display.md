# Story 1.3: Lead List Management & Display

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** sales team member,
**I want** to view and manage my imported leads in an organized, searchable list,
**so that** I can easily navigate through prospects and select specific leads for content generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Lead data displayed using ShadCN DataTable component with sorting capabilities
2. Search functionality filters leads by company name, contact name, or email
3. Batch selection checkboxes enable multi-lead operations
4. Lead count and status indicators show total imported vs. processed leads
5. Individual lead detail view shows all available prospect information
6. Filter options for company, title, or processing status
7. Pagination or virtualization handles large lead lists (1000+) efficiently

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create lead data table with ShadCN DataTable (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Install and configure ShadCN DataTable component
  - [ ] Define lead data structure with TypeScript interfaces
  - [ ] Implement sortable columns for all lead fields
  - [ ] Add table headers with clear field labels

- [ ] Implement search and filter functionality (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Build search input component with real-time filtering
  - [ ] Create search logic for company name, contact name, email
  - [ ] Add filter dropdowns for company, title, processing status
  - [ ] Implement combined search and filter logic

- [ ] Add batch selection capabilities (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement row selection checkboxes with "select all" option
  - [ ] Create selection state management using React state
  - [ ] Build batch operation toolbar (generate content, export, etc.)
  - [ ] Add visual indicators for selected leads

- [ ] Create lead count and status tracking (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Build status indicator component showing total/processed counts
  - [ ] Implement lead processing status tracking
  - [ ] Add visual indicators for lead processing stages
  - [ ] Create progress summary for batch operations

- [ ] Build individual lead detail view (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create lead detail modal or expandable row
  - [ ] Display all available lead information clearly
  - [ ] Add edit capabilities for lead data if needed
  - [ ] Implement close/navigate functionality

- [ ] Optimize performance for large datasets (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement virtualization or pagination for 1000+ leads
  - [ ] Optimize search and filter performance with debouncing
  - [ ] Add loading states for large dataset operations
  - [ ] Test performance with realistic data volumes

## Dev Notes

**Data Management Requirements:**
The lead list will receive data from the CSV import component (Story 1.2) and needs to maintain state for:
- Original imported lead data
- Processing status (imported, generating, reviewed, exported)
- Selection state for batch operations
- Search and filter state

**State Management Architecture:**
Based on the PRD's frontend stack requirements, consider using:
- React Context or Zustand for global lead state management
- Local component state for UI-specific state (search terms, filters)
- Memoization for expensive search and filter operations

**Performance Considerations:**
The PRD requires support for 1000+ leads without performance degradation:
- Virtual scrolling or pagination for large datasets
- Debounced search to prevent excessive re-renders
- Memoized filter functions for complex filtering logic
- Efficient batch selection algorithms

**UI/UX Requirements:**
Following the PRD's "single-page application flow with clear progress indicators":
- Clear visual indicators for lead processing status
- Intuitive batch selection with visual feedback
- Search and filter controls should be discoverable and efficient
- Progress indicators for batch operations

**Integration Points:**
- Receives lead data from CSV Import component (Story 1.2)
- Passes selected leads to AI Content Generation (Story 1.4)
- Maintains selection state throughout workflow

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `src/components/lead-list/__tests__/`

**Test Standards:**
- Component testing for table rendering and interactions
- State management tests for search, filter, and selection
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- DataTable renders lead data correctly with sorting
- Search functionality filters leads accurately
- Batch selection works correctly with multiple leads
- Status tracking updates properly as leads are processed
- Lead detail view displays complete information
- Performance maintained with 1000+ lead datasets
- Accessibility compliance for WCAG AA requirements
