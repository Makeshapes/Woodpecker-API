# Story 3.2: Backend Data Access Layer (DAL) Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a set of functions (the DAL) that handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the database tables,
**so that** this layer contains all the raw SQL queries and logic for interacting with `better-sqlite3` and provides a clean interface for database operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a set of functions (the DAL) that handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the database tables

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 completion:
- SQLite database with full schema is available at `src/database/`
- All tables ready: `imports`, `leads`, `generated_content`, `mappings`, `app_metadata`
- Connection management and utilities implemented at `src/database/init.ts` and `src/database/utils.ts`
- Database automatically initializes on first app launch
- Key functions available: `initializeDatabase()`, `getDatabase()`, `withDatabase()`, `withTransaction()`
- Schema version 1.0.0 with migration support via `app_metadata` table

### Data Models
Based on Story 3.1 implementation, the following table schemas are available:

**imports table:**
- Fields: id, filename, import_date, status, lead_count, error_messages
- Tracks CSV import sessions

**leads table:**
- Fields: id, import_id (FK), company, contact_name, email, title, additional_fields (JSON), status, woodpecker_campaign_id, export_date, created_at
- Stores individual lead data from CSV imports

**generated_content table:**
- Fields: id, lead_id (FK), touchpoint_number, content, content_type, template_id, status, generated_at, approved_at
- Stores AI-generated email sequences

**mappings table:**
- Fields: id, import_id (FK), csv_column, woodpecker_field, mapping_type, is_active, created_at
- Stores field mappings between CSV columns and Woodpecker API fields

**app_metadata table:**
- Fields: key, value, updated_at
- Application configuration and state

### API Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### File Locations
Based on Epic 3 requirements and Story 3.1 implementation:
- DAL functions should be created in `src/database/dal/` directory
- Separate DAL modules for each table: `imports.ts`, `leads.ts`, `generated_content.ts`, `mappings.ts`, `app_metadata.ts`
- Main DAL export file: `src/database/dal/index.ts`
- Existing database utilities at `src/database/utils.ts` should be leveraged
- Use existing connection management from `src/database/init.ts`

### Testing Requirements
No specific guidance found in architecture docs. Based on Story 3.1 testing approach:
- Test files should be created in `src/database/dal/__tests__/` directory
- Follow existing testing patterns from Story 3.1
- Test coverage should include CRUD operations, error handling, and edge cases
- Use existing database testing utilities and mocking patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Use `better-sqlite3` library for all database operations (already installed)
- Leverage existing connection management and transaction support from Story 3.1
- Must maintain data integrity with proper foreign key handling
- Performance must be optimized for bulk operations (CSV imports)
- All SQL queries should use prepared statements for security
- Error handling must be comprehensive with proper logging

### Testing
**Test file location:** `src/database/dal/__tests__/`
**Test standards:** Follow patterns established in Story 3.1
**Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** Jest (based on existing project structure)
**Specific testing requirements:**
- CRUD operation tests for each table
- Transaction and rollback tests
- Error handling and validation tests
- Performance tests for bulk operations
- Data integrity and constraint tests
