## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.2 completion:
- Complete Claude API proxy implementation established secure IPC pattern
- IPC bridge infrastructure functional with `window.api` pattern in preload script
- Secure context isolation confirmed (`contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`)
- Main process service architecture established in `src/main/services/` directory
- Environment variable security pattern proven with Claude API key migration
- Comprehensive testing framework established for main process services and IPC handlers

### Data Models
Based on existing Woodpecker integration patterns:
- **Campaign Interface**: Campaign ID, name, status, and configuration data
- **Prospect Interface**: Email, name, company, title, and custom fields
- **ProspectAddRequest**: Prospect data with campaign ID and email sequence content
- **WoodpeckerResponse**: API response with success/failure status and error details
- **CampaignListResponse**: Array of available campaigns with metadata
- **WoodpeckerApiError**: Categorized error handling (rate_limit, network, auth, validation, unknown)

### API Specifications
**Main Process Woodpecker Service APIs:**
- `getCampaigns()`: Retrieve list of existing Woodpecker campaigns
- `addProspectToCampaign(campaignId, prospectData)`: Add single prospect to campaign
- `addProspectsToCampaign(campaignId, prospects[])`: Batch add prospects to campaign
- `validateProspectData(prospectData)`: Validate prospect data before API submission
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute with automatic reset (following Woodpecker API limits)
- Request tracking and quota management

**IPC Bridge Specifications:**
- **Channel**: `woodpecker:get-campaigns` - Retrieve campaign list
- **Channel**: `woodpecker:add-prospects` - Add prospects to campaign
- **Request Format**: `{ campaignId: string, prospects: ProspectData[] }`
- **Response Format**: `IpcResponse<WoodpeckerResponse>` (following Claude API IPC pattern)
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with category and retry information

### Component Specifications
**Main Process Architecture:**
- **Woodpecker Service**: `src/main/services/woodpeckerService.ts` - Secure API handling
- **IPC Handlers**: `src/main/ipc/woodpeckerHandlers.ts` - Request/response bridge
- **Environment Config**: API key management in main process only
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error categorization and user-friendly messages

**Frontend Integration:**
- **Campaign Service**: Modified to use IPC instead of direct API calls
- **Prospect Export Service**: Updated to use IPC bridge for all Woodpecker operations
- **API Client Removal**: Remove direct Woodpecker API client from frontend
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing UI component interfaces

### File Locations
Based on established Electron project structure from Stories 4.1 and 4.2:
- **Main Process Service**: `src/main/services/woodpeckerService.ts` (new)
- **IPC Handlers**: `src/main/ipc/woodpeckerHandlers.ts` (new)
- **Preload Updates**: `src/preload/preload.ts` (modify to add Woodpecker IPC methods)
- **Frontend Services**: Update existing services to use IPC instead of direct API calls
- **Environment Files**: `.env.development`, `.env.production` (update API key configuration)
- **Package Dependencies**: Remove Woodpecker API client from frontend, add to main process

### Technical Constraints
**Electron Security Model (from Stories 4.1 and 4.2):**
- `nodeIntegration: false` - No Node.js access in renderer process
- `contextIsolation: true` - Secure context separation between main and renderer
- `webSecurity: true` - Standard web security policies enforced
- All external API calls must go through main process

**Woodpecker API Requirements:**
- Node.js environment required for HTTP client libraries
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute (API limitation)
- Authentication via API key in headers
- JSON request/response format for all operations
- Request/response serialization for IPC communication

**Environment Security:**
- API keys accessible only in main process
- No sensitive data exposure to renderer process
- Secure IPC communication with proper validation
- Error messages sanitized for frontend display

### Testing
**Test file location:** `src/main/__tests__/services/` and `src/main/__tests__/ipc/`
**Test standards:** Follow patterns from Stories 4.1 and 4.2 using Vitest with Electron mocks
**Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** Vitest with Electron API mocks, IPC testing utilities
**Specific testing requirements:**
- Main process Woodpecker service initialization and API calls
- IPC handler registration and request/response handling
- API key security verification (renderer cannot access)
- Campaign retrieval and prospect addition workflows through IPC bridge
- Error handling and retry logic in secure context
- Batch prospect operations through main process
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Duplicate prospect detection and prevention
