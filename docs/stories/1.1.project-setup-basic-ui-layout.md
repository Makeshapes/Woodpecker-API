# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic UI Layout

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the foundational project structure with all required dependencies,
**so that** the team has a consistent development environment and UI framework ready for feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vite + React + TypeScript project initialized with proper folder structure
2. Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components installed and configured
3. Basic application layout with header, navigation, and main content areas
4. Development server runs successfully with hot reloading
5. ESLint and Prettier configured for code consistency
6. Basic routing structure established using React Router
7. Environment variable configuration setup for API keys

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Vite project with React and TypeScript template (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create project structure with src/, public/, docs/ folders
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
  - [ ] Set up proper folder structure (components/, pages/, hooks/, utils/)

- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install Tailwind CSS dependencies
  - [ ] Configure tailwind.config.js with ShadCN UI settings
  - [ ] Install ShadCN UI CLI and initialize project
  - [ ] Install core ShadCN components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)

- [ ] Create basic application layout and routing (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Build main layout component with header and navigation
  - [ ] Install and configure React Router
  - [ ] Create basic page components (Dashboard, Import, Export)
  - [ ] Set up route structure for main application flow

- [ ] Configure development environment (AC: 4, 5, 7)
  - [ ] Set up ESLint with React and TypeScript rules
  - [ ] Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
  - [ ] Create .env template file for API keys
  - [ ] Configure Vite for environment variable handling
  - [ ] Test development server startup and hot reloading

## Dev Notes

**Project Structure:**
Based on the PRD requirements, the project should follow modern React patterns with TypeScript for type safety. The application will be a single-page application (SPA) with clear workflow progression.

**Technology Stack Requirements:**
- Vite for fast development and building
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI for consistent, professional styling
- React Router for navigation between workflow steps
- Environment variables for secure API key management

**UI Framework Choice:**
ShadCN UI provides professional, accessible components that align with the PRD's requirement for WCAG AA compliance and clean, efficient workflow-focused interface.

**Folder Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── pages/              # Main route pages (Dashboard, Import, Review, Export)
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── lib/                # Configuration and setup files
```

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `src/__tests__/` and co-located `*.test.tsx` files

**Test Standards:**
- Use Vitest as the test runner (integrates with Vite)
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Test setup and teardown in setupTests.ts
- Mock external dependencies and API calls

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Component render tests for Layout and basic routing
- Configuration tests for environment variable handling
- Integration tests for development server startup
