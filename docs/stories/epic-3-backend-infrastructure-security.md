# Epic 3: Backend Infrastructure & Security

## Epic Goal

Implement secure backend infrastructure by creating an Express server that proxies all external API calls, moving Claude and Woodpecker integrations from frontend to backend for enhanced security and rate limiting. This epic transforms the Phase 1 prototype into a production-ready architecture with proper API key management and comprehensive error handling.

## Epic Description

**Project Context:**

- **Project Type:** Architecture transformation from Phase 1 prototype to Phase 2 production-ready system
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js + Express backend added to existing React frontend
- **Integration Points:** Backend proxy for Claude AI and Woodpecker APIs, frontend-backend communication

**Epic Details:**

- **What's being created:** Secure Express backend server with API proxy capabilities
- **How it integrates:** Replaces direct frontend API calls with secure backend proxy pattern
- **Success criteria:** All external API calls routed through secure backend with enhanced error handling and rate limiting

## Stories

1. **Story 3.1:** Express Backend Server Setup & API Routing - Node.js Express server with RESTful API routes
2. **Story 3.2:** Claude API Proxy & Rate Limiting - Secure backend proxy for AI content generation with rate limiting
3. **Story 3.3:** Woodpecker API Proxy & Integration Security - Secure backend proxy for campaign management
4. **Story 3.4:** Enhanced Error Handling & Logging Infrastructure - Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Frontend application continues to function with backend API endpoints
- [ ] All existing user workflows remain unchanged from user perspective
- [ ] API response formats maintain compatibility with frontend expectations
- [ ] Environment configuration supports both development and production deployments
- [ ] CORS configuration allows frontend-backend communication securely

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Migration from direct API calls to backend proxy disrupts existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Phased migration with parallel testing, comprehensive integration tests, and rollback capabilities
- **Rollback Plan:** Frontend can temporarily revert to direct API calls if backend proxy fails

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 4 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Frontend successfully communicates with backend for all external API operations
- [ ] API keys secured in backend environment variables, removed from frontend
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion across all integrations
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback while hiding sensitive details
- [ ] Logging infrastructure enables debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved compared to Phase 1 direct calls

## Success Metrics

- API response times remain under 5 seconds for AI generation
- Error recovery mechanisms automatically handle 95%+ of temporary API failures
- API key security audit shows no credentials exposed in frontend code
- Rate limiting successfully prevents quota exhaustion during peak usage

## Dependencies

- Epic 1 & Epic 2 completed with working Phase 1 prototype
- Node.js development environment configured
- Production deployment environment prepared
- API keys available for secure backend configuration

## Integration Points

- **From Epic 1 & 2:** Frontend application with direct API integrations
- **To Epic 4:** Backend will be enhanced with database integration
- **External APIs:** Claude AI API, Woodpecker API (moved to secure backend proxy)

## Architecture Transformation

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Migration:**
- Direct frontend API calls → Backend proxy pattern
- Environment variables in frontend → Secure backend environment
- Client-side rate limiting → Server-side rate limiting and queuing
- Basic error handling → Comprehensive error handling with logging

## Handoff Notes for Story Development

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this architecture transformation epic. Key considerations:

- This transforms the Phase 1 prototype into production-ready Phase 2 architecture
- Integration points: Migration from frontend direct API calls to backend proxy pattern
- Existing patterns to maintain: All user workflows and frontend interfaces remain unchanged
- Critical requirements: API security, rate limiting, comprehensive error handling, logging infrastructure
- Each story must include migration testing to ensure no functionality regression
- Focus on seamless transition that enhances security without disrupting user experience

The epic should deliver production-ready backend infrastructure while maintaining all existing user functionality."
