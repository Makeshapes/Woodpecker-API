# Story 1.4: Claude AI Integration & Content Generation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** sales team member,
**I want** to generate personalized 6-touchpoint email sequences using AI,
**so that** I can create high-quality, customized outreach content without manual writing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Claude API integration configured with environment variable API key management
2. Existing refined prompt template loaded and used for content generation
3. Generate 6-touchpoint email sequence for selected leads
4. Loading states and progress indicators during AI content generation
5. Retry logic implemented for failed generation attempts with user feedback
6. Generated content displays in structured format (touchpoint 1-6)
7. Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion with user notifications
8. Error handling for API failures with clear user guidance

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up Claude API integration (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Install Claude AI SDK or HTTP client library
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for API key management
  - [ ] Create Claude API service module with proper error handling
  - [ ] Implement authentication and request headers

- [ ] Load and implement prompt template system (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create prompt template storage (JSON/YAML configuration)
  - [ ] Build template variable substitution system
  - [ ] Implement template loading with lead data injection
  - [ ] Add validation for required template variables

- [ ] Build content generation workflow (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Create content generation function for single leads
  - [ ] Implement 6-touchpoint sequence generation logic
  - [ ] Build structured content parsing and formatting
  - [ ] Add content validation and quality checks

- [ ] Implement UI for content generation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Build generation trigger interface (buttons, batch actions)
  - [ ] Create loading states with progress indicators
  - [ ] Design content display components for 6-touchpoint sequences
  - [ ] Add generation status tracking per lead

- [ ] Add retry logic and error handling (AC: 5, 8)
  - [ ] Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
  - [ ] Create retry button UI for failed generations
  - [ ] Build comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
  - [ ] Add error categorization (API limits, network, content issues)

- [ ] Implement rate limiting and quota management (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Add request queuing system for batch operations
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting based on Claude API quotas
  - [ ] Create quota usage tracking and user notifications
  - [ ] Add intelligent batching for large lead sets

## Dev Notes

**Claude API Integration Requirements:**
Based on the PRD, this is Phase 1 with direct frontend API integration. The system should:
- Use environment variables for secure API key storage (frontend .env)
- Handle Claude API rate limits (typically 100 requests/minute)
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Support the existing refined prompt template mentioned in the PRD

**Prompt Template System:**
The PRD mentions "existing refined Claude prompt template" which suggests:
- Template is already tested and optimized for the sales team
- Variables include: company, contact name, title, and other lead data
- Output format generates 6 distinct touchpoints for email sequences
- Template should be configurable but have sensible defaults

**Content Generation Flow:**
1. User selects leads from Lead List (Story 1.3)
2. System batches requests to respect API rate limits
3. For each lead, inject data into prompt template
4. Call Claude API with structured prompt
5. Parse and validate generated 6-touchpoint content
6. Update lead status and display generated content

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Queue requests to stay within API limits
- Provide clear user feedback about queue position
- Allow cancellation of queued requests
- Implement intelligent batching (5-10 leads per batch)

**Error Handling Categories:**
- API Rate Limit: Show queue status, suggest waiting
- Network Errors: Offer retry with backoff
- Content Generation Errors: Show specific failure reason
- Quota Exhaustion: Show usage stats and suggest action

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `src/services/__tests__/` and `src/components/content-generation/__tests__/`

**Test Standards:**
- API integration tests with mocked Claude responses
- Template system unit tests with various lead data
- Error handling tests for different failure scenarios
- Performance tests for batch generation workflows

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Claude API integration connects successfully with valid credentials
- Prompt template system substitutes lead data correctly
- Content generation produces valid 6-touchpoint sequences
- Loading states and progress indicators work correctly
- Retry logic handles failures gracefully with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
- Error messages provide clear, actionable guidance
- Performance acceptable for batch generation of 50+ leads
