# Story 1.4: Claude AI Integration & Content Generation

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** sales team member,
**I want** to generate personalized 6-touchpoint email sequences using AI from selected leads on the Leads page,
**so that** I can create high-quality, customized outreach content without manual writing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Claude API integration configured with CLAUDE_API_KEY environment variable
2. Existing refined prompt template loaded and used for content generation
3. Generate 6-touchpoint email sequence with 7 snippets total for selected leads from Leads page
4. Loading states and progress indicators during AI content generation
5. Retry logic implemented for failed generation attempts with user feedback
6. Generated content displays in structured format (7 snippets: subject/email/linkedin/bumps) within Leads page context
7. Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion with user notifications
8. Error handling for API failures with clear user guidance
9. Generated content persisted with lead data for later viewing/editing
10. Individual lead content generation status tracking and display

## Dev Notes

**Claude API Integration Requirements:**
Based on the PRD, this is Phase 1 with direct frontend API integration. The system should:
- Use CLAUDE_API_KEY environment variable for secure API key storage (already configured in .env.example)
- Handle Claude API rate limits (typically 100 requests/minute)  
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Support the existing refined prompt template mentioned in the PRD
- Integrate seamlessly with Story 1.3's Leads page architecture and localStorage system

**Prompt Template System:**
The refined Claude prompt template generates 7 snippets for 6-touchpoint sequence:

**SNIPPET MAPPING (7 TOTAL)**
- snippet1: Day 1 Email SUBJECT LINE (plain text, 36-50 chars)
- snippet2: Day 1 Email BODY (HTML formatted, 150-200 words)
- snippet3: Day 3 LinkedIn message (plain text, <300 chars)
- snippet4: Day 7 Bump email (HTML formatted, short)
- snippet5: Day 12 Email (HTML formatted, 150-200 words)
- snippet6: Day 17 Bump email (HTML formatted, short)
- snippet7: Day 25 Breakup email (HTML formatted, 150-200 words)

**Template Requirements:**
- Variables include: company, contact name, title, email, industry, linkedin_url
- Output format: JSON with all lead fields + 7 snippets
- HTML formatting for main emails (snippets 2,4,5,6,7) using `<div>` tags
- Plain text for subject line (snippet1) and LinkedIn (snippet3)
- Structured email format: Opening → Peer Proof → Their ROI → Soft CTA

**Content Generation Flow:**
1. User selects leads from Leads page and clicks Generate button (Story 1.3 integration)
2. System batches requests to respect API rate limits
3. For each lead, inject data into prompt template
4. Call Claude API with structured prompt expecting JSON response with 7 snippets
5. Parse and validate generated 7-snippet content (subject, emails, linkedin, bumps)
6. Update lead status, persist content to localStorage, and display in Leads page context

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Queue requests to stay within API limits
- Provide clear user feedback about queue position
- Allow cancellation of queued requests
- Implement intelligent batching (5-10 leads per batch)

**Error Handling Categories:**
- API Rate Limit: Show queue status, suggest waiting
- Network Errors: Offer retry with backoff
- Content Generation Errors: Show specific failure reason
- Quota Exhaustion: Show usage stats and suggest action

### Testing

**Test File Location:** `src/services/__tests__/` and `src/components/content-generation/__tests__/`

**Test Standards:**
- API integration tests with mocked Claude responses
- Template system unit tests with various lead data
- Error handling tests for different failure scenarios
- Performance tests for batch generation workflows

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Claude API integration connects successfully with valid credentials
- Prompt template system substitutes lead data correctly
- Content generation produces valid JSON response with 7 snippets
- All 7 snippets generated with correct formatting (HTML vs plain text)
- Loading states and progress indicators work correctly
- Retry logic handles failures gracefully with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
- Error messages provide clear, actionable guidance
- Performance acceptable for batch generation of 50+ leads
- Content validation ensures all required snippets are present and properly formatted
